# Changelog

## yieldcurves 0.1.0

CRAN release: 2026-03-26

- Initial release.
- Nelson-Siegel (1987) and Svensson (1994) yield curve fitting with
  multi-start optimization and optional observation weights.
- Cubic spline interpolation via
  [`stats::splinefun`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/splinefun.html).
- Forward rate extraction (analytical for NS/Svensson, numerical for
  splines).
- Discount factor computation with continuous, annual, and semi-annual
  compounding.
- Duration and convexity for zero-coupon bonds via
  [`yc_duration()`](https://charlescoverdale.github.io/yieldcurves/reference/yc_duration.md).
- Coupon bond duration, modified duration, and convexity via
  [`yc_bond_duration()`](https://charlescoverdale.github.io/yieldcurves/reference/yc_bond_duration.md)
  (annual, semi-annual, or continuous compounding).
- Z-spread computation via
  [`yc_zspread()`](https://charlescoverdale.github.io/yieldcurves/reference/yc_zspread.md).
- Key rate durations via
  [`yc_key_rate_duration()`](https://charlescoverdale.github.io/yieldcurves/reference/yc_key_rate_duration.md).
- Par-to-zero and zero-to-par rate conversions via bootstrap stripping,
  supporting annual and semi-annual coupon frequencies.
- Principal component decomposition of yield curve time series.
- Carry and roll-down analysis.
- Slope measures (2s10s, 2s30s, butterfly) and level-slope-curvature
  decomposition.
